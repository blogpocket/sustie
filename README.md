# Blogpocket Sustie

Hello. I'm a super-lightweight theme called `Blogpocket Sustie` and I'm the little brother of the [Susty WordPress theme](https://sustywp.com).
Just as my older brother was created to demonstrate how small a WordPress site can be, I come to show that anyone can design their own theme with Gutenberg.
 
**Note:** I am an experiment of minimalism and demonstration of what you can build only with Gutenberg blocks, without coding anything. The purpose of this theme is to provide a code - sufficiently sufficient - to power the Sustie interface. You can watch the demo on [antoniocambronero.com] (https://antoniocambronero.com). Therefore, as in Susty, it is not recommended that you continue and activate your blog or production website without first making some adjustments.

More information about the installation, configuration, adjustments and objectives of this theme in the blog of https://lanzatu.blog/sustie.
